# SEMITTER

## semantic-commit-formatter

version: 1.0.0

WHAT? You mean I can insert my git commit here and Semmitter(the semantic git commit formatter) will give it back to ctl-c + ctl-v on my git repo? Word up!!!

This application is a nodejs/fastify based application that helps enforcing and standardizing Conventional Commits across a team of developers.
How it works:

1. run the server
2. go to http://localhost:8081/commit/input
3. fill the form
4. click on format
5. copy + paste the formatted output to your git commit as a comment.
